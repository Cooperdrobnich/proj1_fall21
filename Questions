Reflections: 
I think that as expected the data supports the idea that minorities are often underrepresented in upper level highschool classes such as CSA, and this asserts that more needs to be done to correct this outcome. 
I think if I were to display this information visually, it would be best to keep the illustration simple and use a bar graph. I think using a bar graph would be able to convey important information that someone's eyes can actually see quickly and easily. I know when I was examining the data it was hard on my eyes even when information was sorted properly. 
I think the main thing the data is missing would be comparisons to other classes. The AP Computer Science A class is certainly not representative of a student body, so it may be beneficial to look at percentage differences between different AP classes.
I think the CSA analysis provides a broader story relating to educational equality based on race and ethnicity, but it is certainly limited by the fact that it is focusing only on one class.
